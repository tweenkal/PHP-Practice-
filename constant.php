<!--Constants work just like variables. Just like you store your 
    value in a variable, you can also store your value in a constant.
    But you can change the value in a variable. Whereas, once you
    store the value in a constant, you cannot change it and if you 
    do, it will give an error. constant is a fixed value.-->
